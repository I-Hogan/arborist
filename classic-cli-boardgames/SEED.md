I want a command line interface and a clean, modern webpage that will play any 
classic boardgame against the user or itself. Local only is fine for the webpage.

They should have a nice menu to select the game. The user should have a limited but 
useful set of UI navigation tools. For now, start with a few of the most popular 
classic boardgames.

The difficulty of the computer player should challenge and intermediate player.
