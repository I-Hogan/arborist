I want a user-friendly command line tool that will play any classic boardgame against the user.

It should have a single script that has a nice menu to select the game. The user should 
have a limited but useful set of UI navigation tools. For now, start with the 3 most popular 
classic boardgames.

The difficulty of the computer player should challenge and intermediate player.
