# A list of tasks that need doing. (Should be empty except for the title when there are not tasks remaining)

1. Review the changes against `code_review.md` and fix any issues; re-run `scripts/pre_commit.sh` if needed.
2. Verify the definition of done: list files live under `arborist/`, discovery/setup/prompting/cleanup use the new paths, docs mention the new structure, and the test/formatting workflow has been run.
