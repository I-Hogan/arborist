# This file outlines how to do initial setup of a new project

## Case 1: Blank project with only SEED.md

Copy templates/* into the new directory. This is a general
template for any new project. Never modify the templates unless
specifically instructed. All following instructions should be
executed in the new project.

## Case 2: Work-in-progress project missing Arborist files

Ensure the project matches the arborist layout by rearranging and adding any missing
files/directories from templates/* without overwriting existing files. 
If a file already exists, keep it and do not replace it; 
only add the missing ones. This should result in the project having the standard
Arborist files (tasks.md, todo.md, feedback.md, AGENTS.md, etc.) while
preserving existing work.

Make sure all the steps in the template tasks.md have already been completed 
for the project, i.e. tests and static checks are runnable from the script.
