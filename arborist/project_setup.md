# This file outlines how to do initial setup of a new project

## Step 1: Copy all the template files into the new project

Copy templates/* into the new directory. This is a general 
template for any new project. Never modify the templates unless 
specifically instructed. All following instructions should be 
executed in the new project.

## Step 2: Initialize `tasks.md` the following list of setup tasks

1. Come up with a high level plan for the project and write it out in 
`spec.md`. Brainstorm which language(s)/framework(s) you will need to start 
the project. Follow `best_practices.md` and fill in those details here as well. 
Update the index sections of the readmes.
2. Based on the languages and frameworks used, create a script that runs all
automatic style checks that will be run in this project. See `best_practices.md`.
3. Create a testing script to run all the fast tests. See `best_practices.md`.


## Step 3: If you learned any lessons from setting up this project, update this doc
