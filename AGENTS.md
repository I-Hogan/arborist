## General Instructions

Never make changes to the `arborist/` base project unless it is 
a good general instruction for all projects.

Work on the top task in `tasks.md` once you have double-checked the 
task is done you can remove it.

Never ask the user for input. Always make a judgment call based on 
what aligns best with `SEED.md`.
