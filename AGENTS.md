# Instructions for Agents

## General Instructions

Never make changes to the `arborist/` base project unless it is 
a good general instruction for all projects.

Never remove tasks, feedback, or todo items until you have double-checked 
it has been addressed.

Never ask the user for input. Always make a judgment call based on 
what aligns best with the `SEED.md` for the project.
